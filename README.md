Hi there!!

Presenting you the the project "**e-commerce**" site built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) is a web application that allows users to purchase products online. It has features such as login and logout to allow users to create an account and manage their personal information, a search bar to help users find specific products, the ability to add items to a virtual shopping cart, the ability to place an order for the items in the cart, and the option to remove items from the cart. 

MERN stack is a popular stack of technologies for building modern web applications. It consists of the following technologies:

**MongoDB** : A cross-platform document-oriented database program used to store data in JSON-like format with flexible schemas.

**Express.js**: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications and APIs.

**React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows developers to create reusable UI components.

**Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.

These technologies work together to provide a full-stack solution for building web applications. MongoDB is used to store data, Express.js is used to handle routing and provide an API for the front-end to access the database, React.js is used to build the user interface, and Node.js is used to run the server and handle server-side logic.
